block: IRON_BLOCK
# The base block to modify. Please refer to "Block Providers"
# in the docs for more information about what you can put here.

hardness: # These values are in ticks!
  base: 20 # This value is optional! If not specified, the base value will use the max breaking time.
  # The base value is the time it takes to break the block if no states have activated.
  min: 5 # The minimum amount of ticks it should take to break the block
  max: 30 # The maximum amount of ticks it should take to break the block

use-modifiers:
  vanilla: # THIS IS CURRENTLY VERY BUGGY! USE AT OWN RISK - Currently requires Unstable Mode
    enabled: false # Whether to use any of these modifiers.
    tools: false # Whether vanilla tool modifiers should be used (For example, using a Diamond Pick on a Cobblestone block)
    efficiency: true # Whether the efficiency enchantment should be considered
    haste: true # Whether the haste effect should be considered
    water: true # Whether being in water should affect breaking speed (like in Vanilla)
    air: true # Whether being in the air should affect breaking speed (like in Vanilla)

states: # Please refer to "States" in the docs.
  - helditem{type=diamond_pickaxe;value=5} # Will subtract 5 ticks from the breaking time.
  # But only if the player is holding a Diamond Pickaxe. See docs for available states, etc.
  - sneaking{value=10} # Will subtract 3 ticks from the breaking time.
  # If both of the above states activate then the total breaking time in ticks will become 5, since
  # the base value is 20 and the helditem state subtracts 5 ticks and the sneaking state subtracts 10 ticks.
  # '20 - 5 - 10 = 5' (Note, the minimum is also set to 5, so it can't go lower than that)
  - helditem{type=iron_pickaxe} # Will use the default "value" of '1'

  # WIP - This hasn't been properly implemeneted yet
  # Currently requires Unstable Mode
  #- states{s=[- helditem{type=iron_pickaxe} - sneaking{}];value=50}

triggers: # Please refer to "Triggers" in the docs.
  - break{command=say I broke a block!}
  # This trigger will execute the command "say I broke a block!"
  # when the player finishes breaking the block.
  #- start{skill=MyThiccSkill} # - - - Using a skill requires MythicMobs - - -
  # This trigger will execute a MythicMobs skill called "MyThiccSkill"
  # when the player starts breaking the block (if the skill can be found).

# Possible triggers are: 'start', 'stop', 'break' or 'abort'
# Possible functions are: 'skill', 'command', 'event'
# More information about each trigger/function is available in the docs.
