block: IRON_BLOCK
# The base block to modify. Please refer to "Block Providers"
# on the wiki for more information about what you can put here.

breaking-time: # This value is in ticks!
  max: 30 # The maximum amount of ticks it should take to break the block
  min: 5 # The minimum amount of ticks it should take to break the block
  base: 20 # This value is optional! If not specified, the base value will use the max breaking time.
  # The base value is the time it takes to break the block if no states have activated.

states: # Please refer to "Break States" on the wiki.
- helditem{type=diamond_pickaxe;value=5} # Will subtract 5 ticks from the breaking time.
# But only if the player is holding a Diamond Pickaxe. See wiki for available states, etc.
- sneaking{value=10} # Will subtract 3 ticks from the breaking time.
# If both of the above states activate then the total breaking time in ticks will become 5, since
# the base value is 20 and the helditem state subtracts 5 ticks and the sneaking state subtracts 10 ticks.
# '20 - 5 - 10 = 5' (Note, the minimum is also set to 5, so it can't go lower than that)
- helditem{type=iron_pickaxe} # Will use the default "value" of '1'

triggers: # Please refer to "Break Triggers" on the wiki.
- start{skill="MyThiccSkill"}
# - - - Using a skill requires MythicMobs - - -
# This trigger will execute a MythicMobs skill called "MyThiccSkill"
# when the player starts breaking the block (if the skill can be found).
# Possible triggers are: 'start', 'stop', 'break' or 'abort'
# More information about each trigger is available on the wiki.
